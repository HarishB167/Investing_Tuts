- LESSON 2 : Bond Components

1. What is a Par Value
2. What is a Coupon
3. What is the Term
4. What is Market Value for a Bond

* Par Value
> Value at which bond was issued.
> Value which will be received at maturity

* Coupon
> Bi-anually interest payment

* Term
> Time for maturity of bond

* Market Value for a Bond
> If interest rate increases
then value of bond is decreased and with time value increases.
> If interest rate decreases
then value of bond is increased and with time value decreases.

- LESSON 3 : Value a Bond and yield to maturity
* Objective
1. Simple Interest
2. Compound Interest
3. Current Yield
4. Yield to Maturity

* Simple Interest
> Interest received : Summing up all coupons
> Coupon yield = 1 year coupon payment / Par Value
It is set when a bond is issued. It is the
annual coupon divided by the par value.
> Current yield = 1 year coupon payment / Price on market
It is annual coupon divied by the price (on stock market of bond).
It does not account for money lost/gained at maturity, i.e.,
Par value - Price on market.

* Compound Interest
> Compount interest : when coupon payment is re-invested at coupon yield.
> Yield to maturity :
It includes - compound interest, par gain/loss.
It accounts for money lost/gained at maturity, i.e.,
Par value - Price on market.
This changes more than current yield, due to price change of bond.
> Yield to maturity equation :
YTM = (FaceValue/CurrentPrice)^(1/2) - 1
BondValue = (C/2)[{1-(1+YTM/2)^(-2t)}/(YTM/2)] + F/[{1+(YTM/2)}^2t]
C = annual coupon payment
F = face value of bond
t = number of years remaining until maturity

Section - Part 1 - Beginners - Economic Machine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0

- Economy 
* Works in simple, mechanical way
* It's made up of few simple parts and 
lot of simple transactions repeated many times.
* These transactions are driven by human nature.
* These transactions create 3 main forces that drive the economy.
1. Productivity growth
2. Short term debt cycle
3. Long term debt cycle

- Transactions
* Economy is simply the sum of transactions.
* Each transaction consists of :
buyer, seller, exchanging money or credit with
goods, services, financial assets.
* Total spending = money spent + credit spent
* Total spending drives the economy
* Price = total spending / total quantity

- Market
* Consists of all the buyers and sellers.
* Making transactions for the same thing.
* E.g. : wheat, car, stock market 
* Economy consists of all of the transaction in
its all of the markets.
* To understand economy -> total spending / total quantity

* Biggest buyer / seller is government
* Government consist of : central government, 
central bank.
* Central government : collects taxes and spends money
* Central bank : controls amount of money and credit in
the economy. By changing interest rates and printing money.
> Important player in flow of credit.

- Credit
* Economy's important part and least understood.
* It's biggest and most volatile part.
* Similar to buyers and sellers transactions, lender and borrower
* Lenders : Make their money into more money
* Borrowers : Want to buy they can't afford.
* Debt is created with credit
* Debt is asset to lender, and
liability to borrower
* Spending drives economy, because one person's spending
is other person's income.

- Credit worth borrower
* Ability to repay
* Collateral if he can't

- Economic growth Cycles
* 3-forces : Productivity, Debt swings 7-8 years,
75-100 years
* Productivity matters in long run
> Doesn't fluctuate much
> Not a big driver economic swings
> Doesn't cause cycles/swings
* Debt 
> Cycles/Swings are due to Borrowing / Credit
> Credit matters in short run 
> When acquiring : consume more than we produce
> When repaying : consume less than we produce
* Debt swings
> Occur in 2 big cycles :
5-8 years and 75-100 years
> Most people don't see them as cycles, because
they see very zoomed view, day by day, week by week

- Money vs Credit
* Money : used to settle transaction immediately
* Credit : promise to pay in future. Together
borrower and lender created liability and asset, 
out of thin air. Payment done after makes 
asset and liability disappear, and makes
transaction settled.
* Most of money in system is credit.

- Increase spending
* Without credit : only through more productivity
* With credit : also with borrowing, spending power
from future self.
> Allows incomes to rise faster than productivity
over short time.
> It's bad when used for over-consumption, which
can't be paid back.

- Short term debt cycle
* 7-8 years
* Person earning 100,000 and creditworthy of 10,000,
can spend 110,000.
* One person's spending is other person's income.
* So, second person is earning 110,000 and creditworthy
of 11,000, can spend 121,000.
* This pattern goes to 3rd,4th till nth person.
* Now, borrowing creates cycles.
* So, cycles needs to come down.
* Cycle's 1st phase (Expansion) : 
> Credit causes increase in spending.
> Increase in economic activity causes expansion.
> Inflation : When amount of spending and incomes grow faster than 
production of goods, then prices increases.
> Central Bank doesn't like too much inflation.
> It raises interest rates.
> Now, fewer people can afford borrowing.
> Also cost of existing debts rises
* Cycle's 2nd phase (Recession) : 
> People have less money to spend.
> Incomes drop : Since one person's spending is other person's income.
> Deflation : People spend less
> Economic activity decreases, and recession appears.
> When inflation is not problem and recession problem becomes big,
then central bank lowers interest rates.
> Debt repayment are reduced
* Cycle's 1st phase (Expansion) : 
> Borrowing becomes more affordable.
> Expansion appears.
* Spending is constrained : by willingness of lenders and
borrowers to provide and receive credit.
* Bottom and top of cycle finish with more growth and debt than 
previous cycle.
* More debt : because people have inclination to borrow and 
spend more instead of paying back debt.

- Long term debt cycles
* Due to more debt in short term debt cycle.
* Debts rist faster than incomes.
* Lenders give more credit :
> Because everybody thinks things are going great.
> People focus on current events : rising incomes,
asset's value and stock market increasing.
* Debt-burden : Debt/income
* Debt-burden slowly increases - creating larger
debt repayments
* Debt repayment starts growing faster than incomes.
* People are forced to cut spending.
* Incomes of people also go down. Causing less 
creditworthy.
* Causing borrowing to go down.
* Cycle reverses itself.
* Long term debt peak appears.
* Cycle's 2nd phase (Deleveraging) :
> People cut spending
> Income falls
> Credit disapppears
> Asset prices drop : for debt repayment, all people try to sell
> Banks get squeezed : bank runs for fear of bank being failed
due to it's failing loans.
> Stock markets crashes
> Social tension rises
> Interest can't be lowered, as they are already low.
> Economy becomes not creditworthy
> Debt-burden reducing :
1. Cut spending : reduces income and debt remains same and deflation.
2. Debts reduced by restructuring (lenders don't want to debt 
completely disappear), defaulting
3. Redistribute wealth
4. Central bank prints new money

* How debt restructuring causes income and asset value decrease?
